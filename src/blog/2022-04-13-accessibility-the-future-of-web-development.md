`Accessibility` is not a new concept in **programming world**, its been around ever since people start to code or have access to internet, while back then the internet itself not widely used by the masses, some still think about how to make it more accessible for everyone, especially to people that have special needs to make sure they can easily navigate the site.

## The future of Website Development

While I can see that for some people, Web 3.0 is the future and the goal that they want to achieve, I think it's more appropriate for us to aim to help and develop the internet to accommodate people with special needs, not just in terms of facility, but also by the structure of the website itself. I can see in the next couple of years, that the path for accessibility will become more challenging, with more people jump into the Web 3.0 wagon they sometimes forget about how important to make the web itself become more easy to navigate and more safe for everyone to use.
