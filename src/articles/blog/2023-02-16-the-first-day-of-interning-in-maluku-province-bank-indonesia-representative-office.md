> The internship happens for the period _November 1st, 2022 until March 31st, 2023_

==The day starts around 7:42 am==, and I prepare to go to campus to meet up with my head of program study, who is also my mentor for the internship before we prepare to go to the Office<sup>[[1]](#definition)</sup>. _(Representative Office)_ located at Pattimura Street, No. 7, Ambon, Maluku.

## The Meeting & Introduction

==Around 8:30 am EIT==<sup>[[2]](#definition)</sup>, we leave the campus area to the destination place of my internship office<sup>[[1]](#definition)</sup>. Upon arriving at the gateway we wait for the HR department in the Lobby. After less than 5 minutes of waiting, we finally met with Ms. Tari from HR and also who will be my supervisor for the period of my internship after doing the handout and the signing of the MoU<sup>[[3]](#definition)</sup> between the faculty and the Office<sup>[[1]](#definition)</sup>, I followed Ms. Tari to do the tour of the office space and also introducing myself to the rest of the staff there.

### The Day

That day, they were busy handling the archived documents, so I sat down while observing everyone doing their jobs. Around 5:00 pm EIT<sup>[[2]](#definition)</sup>, one of the kaka<sup>[[4]](#definition)</sup> asked me to help him check the list of items/documents, then the other kaka asked me to help him categorize and divide documents based on month and year to be grouped with a quarter of the year after that moving the grouped documents into the box, we were doing it for almost 2 hours, and then I went back at 7:12 pm.

### My Opinion

Nothing much happened on the first day, but it was not as bad and eventful as I imagined.

## Definition

Due to the excessive use of long text in the paragraph, I decided to shorten most of the long text. It will be listed here using a number system.
