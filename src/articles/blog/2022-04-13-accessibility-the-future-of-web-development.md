Right now we are lived in the future, and the crossroad of the next gen of Web Development, many said that **Web 3.0** or `Blockchain based (decentralized)` is the future of web development, while its true that **Web 3.0** will probably dominate the market for the next decades, we can't forget that one aspect of Web development often being **forgotten** by the developers. It is `Accessibility`.

## What is Accessibility?

**Accessibility** can be defined as a way to make application more inclusive and easier to navigate for those that have special needs. With that in mind, **Accessibility** quite important in these time and age, with more access to internet around the world that also means more people with wide range of special needs started to have access to internet.



**Accessibility** it self aren't a new concept in `programming world`, ever since the first code being written people been trying to make it more accessible for everyone to start using it, from _command-line based system_ until _graphical based system_ it slowly try to integrate the aspect of ease of using with the complexity of a system itself, but we can't denied that sometimes we need to sacrificed something, and most of the time **"we"** prefer to make the program more complex with the sacrifice of the ease of use itself.

## The Current state of Accessibility

While **accessibility still in back burner** for most of web developers, some initiative already being launch by large companies to help teach people and rise awareness about it, for example one of my favourite project that I recommended is [A11y](https://www.a11yproject.com/), or the one that from [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/able/).

**Both of the projects** in the end aims to help people to make the web more accessible and more easy to navigate, with `IBM more focus on providing a tool` to test and help develop a better experience for people with special needs, while `A11yProjects want to give out` easy and concise steps to follow for developers to do when they creating a new system or website.

## The future of Accessibility

While talking about the future itself, is quite a stretch itself, but for me I think the future of accessibility is quite mixed, because while there is some initiative that being launch and more people start to be more aware of these problems, at the same time with the rise of Web 3.0 and the development of Web Development enlarge, more people start to deep dive into this field, while *we can't denied that the more people the more pace the development* will happened but at the same time, with that many new developers, some of them will probably takes years or even decades to even start to look into Accessibility itself.

`We can just hope that eventually` there will be more an easy way for developers to fully test and have more comprehensive knowledge on how to develop and maintain website with accessibility in mind.
