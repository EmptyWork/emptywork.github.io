> The Internship will be done for the period of _November 1st 2022 Until 31st March 2023_

The day starts around 7:42 am, I prepare myself to go to campus to meet up with my head of program study who also my academic supervisor for my internship, we preparing to go to Office[[1]](#definition). _(Representative Office)_ located at Pattimura Street, No. 7, Ambon, Maluku.

## The Meeting & Introduction

Around 8:30 am EIT[[2]](#definition), me and my academic supervisor leave the campus area with the destination to the place[[1]](#definition) of where I going to do the intern, upon arriving at the entrance we are waiting for HR department in the Lobby, after less than 5 minutes of waiting, we are able to finally met with Ms. Tari form HR, and also who will be my Supervisor for the period of my internship, after doing the handout and the signing of MoU[[3]](#definition) between the faculty and the office[[1]](#definition), I follow Ms. Tari to do the tour of the office space, and also introducing myself to the rest of the staff there.

### The Day

For the entire day they were busy doing and handling the archived documents, so I am just sit down while observing everyone doing their jobs, around 5:00 pm EIT[[2]](#definition) one of the kaka[[4]](#definition) ask me to help check the list of items/documents, then one other kaka asked me to help him categorizing and dividing documents based on month and year to be grouping with quarter of the year after that putting the grouped documents into the box. we were doing it for almost 2 hours, then I go back by 7:12 pm.

### My Opinion

Honestly nothing much happens on the first day, but it's not as bad as what I think of, and not so eventful as what I am hoping for.

## Definition

Due to the redundant of using long text on the paragraph itself I decided to shorten most of long text, and it will be list in here using number system.
